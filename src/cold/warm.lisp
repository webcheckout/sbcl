;;;; general warm init compilation policy

;;;; Use the same settings as PROCLAIM-TARGET-OPTIMIZATION
;;;; I could not think of a trivial way to ensure that this stays functionally
;;;; identical to the corresponding code in 'compile-cold-sbcl'.
;;;; (One possibility would be to read this form from a lisp-expr file)
;;;; The intent is that we should generate identical code if a file is moved
;;;; from the cross-compiled sources to warm-compiled or vice-versa.
