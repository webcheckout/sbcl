;;;; low-level signal context access functions
;;;;
;;;; Note: In CMU CL, similar functions were hardwired to access
;;;; BSD-style sigcontext structures defined as alien objects. Our
;;;; approach is different in two ways:
;;;;   1. We use POSIX SA_SIGACTION-style signals, so our context is
;;;;      whatever the void pointer in the sigaction handler dereferences
;;;;      to, not necessarily a sigcontext.
;;;;   2. We don't try to maintain alien definitions of the context
;;;;      structure at Lisp level, but instead call alien C functions
;;;;      which take care of access for us. (Since the C functions can
;;;;      be defined in terms of system standard header files, they
;;;;      should be easier to maintain; and since Lisp code uses signal
;;;;      contexts only in interactive or exception code (like the debugger
;;;;      and internal error handling) the extra runtime cost should be
;;;;      negligible.
