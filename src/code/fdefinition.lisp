;;; contains a proof that triangular numbers mod 2^N visit every cell.

;;; The intent here - which may be impossible to realize - was to allow GC
;;; methods whose name is not reachable.  I couldn't get it to do the right thing.
;;; e.g. (defmethod foo (x (y cons)) ...) creates mappings:
;;; (SB-PCL::FAST-METHOD FOO (T CONS)) -> #<SB-KERNEL:FDEFN (SB-PCL::FAST-METHOD FOO (T CONS))>
;;; (SB-PCL::SLOW-METHOD FOO (T CONS)) -> #<SB-KERNEL:FDEFN (SB-PCL::SLOW-METHOD FOO (T CONS))>
;;; where it seems like (unintern 'FOO) should allow both of those to get GCd.
;;; I suspect that it will require hanging those fancily named fdefns off the symbol
;;; FOO rather than having a global table.  Alternatively, that can be simulated by
;;; having GC preserve liveness of any element whenever the second item in the list
;;; comprising fdefn-name is an a-priori live symbol.  That will be more efficient than
;;; having a hash-table hanging off every symbol that names a method.
;;; e.g. both of the preceding names would be hanging off of FOO, as would others
;;; such as (FAST-METHOD FOO :AROUND (LIST INTEGER)) and a myriad of others.
;;; I suspect that any approach of hanging off the symbols will be space-inefficient
;;; and difficult to implement.

;;; At any rate, we can make use of the key-in-value nature of fdefns to halve
;;; the number of words required to store the name -> object mapping.
