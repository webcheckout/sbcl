(defmacro trace (&rest specs)
  "TRACE {Option Global-Value}* {Name {Option Value}*}*

TRACE is a debugging tool that provides information when specified
functions are called. In its simplest form:

       (TRACE NAME-1 NAME-2 ...)

The NAMEs are not evaluated. Each may be a symbol, denoting an
individual function, or a string, denoting all functions fbound to
symbols whose home package is the package with the given name.

Options allow modification of the default behavior. Each option is a
pair of an option keyword and a value form. Global options are
specified before the first name, and affect all functions traced by a
given use of TRACE. Options may also be interspersed with function
names, in which case they act as local options, only affecting tracing
of the immediately preceding function name. Local options override
global options.

By default, TRACE causes a printout on *TRACE-OUTPUT* each time that
one of the named functions is entered or returns. (This is the basic,
ANSI Common Lisp behavior of TRACE.)

The following options are defined:

   :REPORT Report-Type
       If Report-Type is TRACE (the default) then information is
       reported by printing immediately. If Report-Type is NIL, then
       the only effect of the trace is to execute other
       options (e.g. PRINT or BREAK).

   :CONDITION Form
   :CONDITION-AFTER Form
   :CONDITION-ALL Form
       If :CONDITION is specified, then TRACE does nothing unless Form
       evaluates to true at the time of the call. :CONDITION-AFTER is
       similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when the
       function returns. :CONDITION-ALL tries both before and after.

   :BREAK Form
   :BREAK-AFTER Form
   :BREAK-ALL Form
       If specified, and Form evaluates to true, then the debugger is invoked
       at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or both,
       according to the respective option.

   :PRINT Form
   :PRINT-AFTER Form
   :PRINT-ALL Form
       In addition to the usual printout, the result of evaluating Form is
       printed at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or
       both, according to the respective option. Multiple print options cause
       multiple values to be printed.

   :WHEREIN Names
       If specified, Names is a function name or list of names. TRACE does
       nothing unless a call to one of those functions encloses the call to
       this function (i.e. it would appear in a backtrace.)  Anonymous
       functions have string names like \"DEFUN FOO\".

   :ENCAPSULATE {:DEFAULT | T | NIL}
       If T, the default, tracing is done via encapsulation (redefining the
       function name) rather than by modifying the function.  :DEFAULT is
       not the default, but means to use encapsulation for interpreted
       functions and funcallable instances, breakpoints otherwise. When
       encapsulation is used, forms are *not* evaluated in the function's
       lexical environment, but SB-DEBUG:ARG can still be used.

   :METHODS {T | NIL}
       If T, any function argument naming a generic function will have its
       methods traced in addition to the generic function itself.

   :FUNCTION Function-Form
       This is a not really an option, but rather another way of specifying
       what function to trace. The Function-Form is evaluated immediately,
       and the resulting function is traced.

:CONDITION, :BREAK and :PRINT forms are evaluated in a context which
mocks up the lexical environment of the called function, so that
SB-DEBUG:VAR and SB-DEBUG:ARG can be used.
The -AFTER and -ALL forms can use also use SB-DEBUG:ARG. In forms
which are evaluated after the function call, (SB-DEBUG:ARG N) returns
the N-th value returned by the function."
