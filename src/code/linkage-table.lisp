;;;; Linkage table itself is a mmapped memory area in C-land, which is
;;;; initialized by INIT-LINKAGE-TABLE once all shared objects have
;;;; been reopened, based on the information stored in *LINKAGE-INFO*.
;;;;
;;;; For data entries the linkage table holds the real address
;;;; of the foreign symbol, and for code the entries are jumps
;;;; to the real addresses.
