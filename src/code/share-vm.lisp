;;;; OS-CONTEXT-T

;;; a POSIX signal context, i.e. the type passed as the third
;;; argument to an SA_SIGACTION-style signal handler
;;;
;;; The real type does have slots, but at Lisp level, we never
;;; access them, or care about the size of the object. Instead, we
;;; always refer to these objects by pointers handed to us by the C
;;; runtime library, and ask the runtime library any time we need
;;; information about the contents of one of these objects. Thus, it
;;; works to represent this as an object with no slots.
;;;
;;; KLUDGE: It would be nice to have a type definition analogous to
;;; C's "struct os_context_t;", for an incompletely specified object
;;; which can only be referred to by reference, but I don't know how
;;; to do that in the FFI, so instead we just this bogus no-slots
;;; representation. -- WHN 20000730
;;;
;;; FIXME: Since SBCL, unlike CMU CL, uses this as an opaque type,
;;; it's no longer architecture-dependent, and probably belongs in
;;; some other package, perhaps SB-KERNEL.

;; KLUDGE: Linux/MIPS signal context fields are 64 bits wide, even on
;; 32-bit systems.  On big-endian implementations, simply using a
;; pointer to a narrower type DOES NOT WORK because it reads the upper
;; half of the value, not the lower half.  On such systems, we must
;; either read the entire value (and mask down, in case the system
;; sign-extends the value, which has been seen to happen), or offset
;; the pointer in order to read the lower half.  This has been broken
;; at least twice in the past.  MIPS also appears to be the ONLY
;; system for which the signal context field size may differ from
;; n-word-bits (well, and ALPHA, but that's a separate matter), but
;; this entire thing will likely need to be revisited when we add x32
;; or n32 ABI support.
