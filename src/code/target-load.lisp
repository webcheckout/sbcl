;; We'd like, when entering the debugger as a result of an EVAL error,
;; that the condition be annotated with the stream position.
;; One way to do it is catch all conditions and encapsulate them in
;; something new such as a LOADER-EVAL-ERROR and re-signal.
;; The printer for the encapsulated condition has the data it needs to
;; show the original condition and the line/col. That would unfortunately
;; interfere with handlers that were bound around LOAD, since they would
;; only receive the encapsulated condition, and not be able to test for
;; things they're interested in, such as which redefinition warnings to ignore.
;; Instead, printing a herald for any SERIOUS-CONDITION approximates
;; the desired behavior closely enough without printing something for warnings.
;; TODO: It would be supremely cool if, for toplevel PROGN, we could
;; indicate the position of the specific subform that failed
