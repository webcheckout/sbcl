MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS is fundamentally unsafe to use if the user-supplied
function allocates anything. Consider what can happens when NEXT-FREE-PAGE
points to a partially filled page, and one more object is created extending
an allocation region that began on the formerly "last" page:

   0x10027cfff0: 0x00000000000000d9     <-- this was Lisp's view of
   0x10027cfff8: 0x0000000000000006         the last page (page 1273)
   ---- page boundary ----
   0x10027d0000: 0x0000001000005ecf     <-- next_free_page moves here (page 1274)
   0x10027d0008: 0x00000000000000ba
   0x10027d0010: 0x0000000000000040
   0x10027d0018: 0x0000000000000000

Lisp did not think that the page starting at 0x10027d0000 was allocated,
so it believes the stopping point is page 1273.  When we read the bytes-used
on that page, we see a totally full page, but do not consider adjoining any
additional pages into the contiguous block.
However the object, a vector, that started on page 1273 ends on page 1274,
causing MAP-OBJECTS-IN-RANGE to assert that it overran 0x10027d0000.

We could try a few things to mitigate this:
* Try to "chase" the value of next-free-page.  This is literally impossible -
  it's a moving target, and it's extremely likely to exhaust memory doing so,
  especially if the supplied lambda is an interpreted function.
  (Each object scanned causes consing of more bytes, and we never
  "catch up" to the moving next-free-page)

* If the page that we're looking at is full but the FINALLY clause is hit,
  don't stop looking for more pages in that one case. Instead keep looking
  for the end of the contiguous block, but stop as soon as any potential
  stopping point is found; don't chase next-free-page.  This is tricky
  as well and just about as infeasible.

* Pass a flag to MAP-OBJECTS-IN-RANGE specifying that it's OK to
  surpass the expected bound - silently accept our fate.
  This is what we do since it's simple, and seems to work.
