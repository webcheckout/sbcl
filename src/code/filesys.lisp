;;; FIXME: the below shouldn't really be here, but in documentation
;;; (chapter 19 makes a lot of requirements for documenting
;;; implementation-dependent decisions), but anyway it's probably not
;;; what we currently do.
;;;
;;; Unix namestrings have the following format:
;;;
;;; namestring := [ directory ] [ file [ type [ version ]]]
;;; directory := [ "/" ] { file "/" }*
;;; file := [^/]*
;;; type := "." [^/.]*
;;; version := "." ([0-9]+ | "*")
;;;
;;; Note: this grammar is ambiguous. The string foo.bar.5 can be
;;; parsed as either just the file specified or as specifying the
;;; file, type, and version. Therefore, we use the following rules
;;; when confronted with an ambiguous file.type.version string:
;;;
;;; - If the first character is a dot, it's part of the file. It is not
;;; considered a dot in the following rules.
;;;
;;; - Otherwise, the last dot separates the file and the type.
;;;
;;; Wildcard characters:
;;;
;;; If the directory, file, type components contain any of the
;;; following characters, it is considered part of a wildcard pattern
;;; and has the following meaning.
;;;
;;; ? - matches any one character
;;; * - matches any zero or more characters.
;;; [abc] - matches any of a, b, or c.
;;; {str1,str2,...,strn} - matches any of str1, str2, ..., or strn.
;;;   (FIXME: no it doesn't)
;;;
;;; Any of these special characters can be preceded by an escape
;;; character to cause it to be treated as a regular character.

;;;; TRUENAME, PROBE-FILE, FILE-AUTHOR, FILE-WRITE-DATE.

;;; Rewritten in 12/2007 by RMK, replacing 13+ year old CMU code that
;;; made a mess of things in order to support search lists (which SBCL
;;; has never had).  These are now all relatively straightforward
;;; wrappers around stat(2) and realpath(2), with the same basic logic
;;; in all cases.  The wrinkles to be aware of:
;;;
;;; * SBCL defines the truename of an existing, dangling or
;;;   self-referring symlink to be the symlink itself.
;;; * The old version of PROBE-FILE merged the pathspec against
;;;   *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* twice, and so lost when *D-P-D*
;;;   was a relative pathname.  Even if the case where *D-P-D* is a
;;;   relative pathname is problematic, there's no particular reason
;;;   to get that wrong, so let's try not to.
;;; * Note that while stat(2) is probably atomic, getting the truename
;;;   for a filename involves poking all over the place, and so is
;;;   subject to race conditions if other programs mutate the file
;;;   system while we're resolving symlinks.  So it's not implausible for
;;;   realpath(3) to fail even if stat(2) succeeded.  There's nothing
;;;   obvious we can do about this, however.
;;; * Windows' apparent analogue of realpath(3) is called
;;;   GetFullPathName, and it's a bit less useful than realpath(3).
;;;   In particular, while realpath(3) errors in case the file doesn't
;;;   exist, GetFullPathName seems to return a filename in all cases.
;;;   As realpath(3) is not atomic anyway, we only ever call it when
;;;   we think a file exists, so just be careful when rewriting this
;;;   routine.
;;;
;;; Given a pathname designator, some quality to query for, return one
;;; of a pathname, a universal time, or a string (a file-author), or
;;; NIL.  QUERY-FOR may be one of :TRUENAME, :EXISTENCE, :WRITE-DATE,
;;; :AUTHOR.  If ERRORP is false, return NIL in case the file system
;;; returns an error code; otherwise, signal an error.  Accepts
;;; logical pathnames, too (but never returns LPNs).  For internal

;;; NOTE: There is a fair amount of hair below that is probably not
;;; strictly necessary.
;;;
;;; The issue is the following: what does (DIRECTORY "SYS:*;") mean?
;;; Until 2004-01, SBCL's behaviour was unquestionably wrong, as it
;;; did not translate the logical pathname at all, but instead treated
;;; it as a physical one.  Other Lisps seem to to treat this call as
;;; equivalent to (DIRECTORY (TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME "SYS:*;")),
;;; which is fine as far as it goes, but not very interesting, and
;;; arguably counterintuitive.  (PATHNAME-MATCH-P "SYS:SRC;" "SYS:*;")
;;; is true, so why should "SYS:SRC;" not show up in the call to
;;; DIRECTORY?  (assuming the physical pathname corresponding to it
;;; exists, of course).
;;;
;;; So, the interpretation that I am pushing is for all pathnames
;;; matching the input pathname to be queried.  This means that we
;;; need to compute the intersection of the input pathname and the
;;; logical host FROM translations, and then translate the resulting
;;; pathname using the host to the TO translation; this treatment is
;;; recursively invoked until we get a physical pathname, whereupon
;;; our physical DIRECTORY implementation takes over.

;;; FIXME: this is an incomplete implementation.  It only works when
;;; both are logical pathnames (which is OK, because that's the only
;;; case when we call it), but there are other pitfalls as well: see
;;; the DIRECTORY-HELPER below for some, but others include a lack of
;;; pattern handling.

;;; The above was written by CSR, I (RMK) believe.  The argument that
;;; motivates the interpretation is faulty, however: PATHNAME-MATCH-P
;;; returns true for (PATHNAME-MATCH-P #P"/tmp/*/" #P"/tmp/../"), but
;;; the latter pathname is not in the result of DIRECTORY on the
;;; former.  Indeed, if DIRECTORY were constrained to return the
;;; truename for every pathname for which PATHNAME-MATCH-P returned
;;; true and which denoted a filename that named an existing file,
;;; (DIRECTORY #P"/tmp/**/") would be required to list every file on a
;;; Unix system, since any file can be named as though it were "below"
;;; /tmp, given the dotdot entries.  So I think the strongest
;;; "consistency" we can define between PATHNAME-MATCH-P and DIRECTORY
;;; is that PATHNAME-MATCH-P returns true of everything DIRECTORY
;;; returns, but not vice versa.

;;; In any case, even if the motivation were sound, DIRECTORY on a
;;; wild logical pathname has no portable semantics.  I see nothing in
;;; ANSI that requires implementations to support wild physical
;;; pathnames, and so there need not be any translation of a wild
;;; logical pathname to a phyiscal pathname.  So a program that calls
;;; DIRECTORY on a wild logical pathname is doing something
;;; non-portable at best.  And if the only sensible semantics for
;;; DIRECTORY on a wild logical pathname is something like the
;;; following, it would be just as well if it signaled an error, since
;;; a program can't possibly rely on the result of an intersection of
;;; user-defined translations with a file system probe.  (Potentially
;;; useful kinds of "pathname" that might not support wildcards could
;;; include pathname hosts that model unqueryable namespaces like HTTP
;;; URIs, or that model namespaces that it's not convenient to
;;; investigate, such as the namespace of TCP ports that some network
;;; host listens on.  I happen to think it a bad idea to try to
;;; shoehorn such namespaces into a pathnames system, but people
;;; sometimes claim to want pathnames for these things.)  -- RMK

;;; FIXME: Does not work with :UP or :BACK
;;; FIXME: Does not work with patterns
