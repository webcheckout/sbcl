;;;; various constants and essentially-constants

;;; a string which appears at the start of a fasl file header
;;;
;;; This value is used to identify fasl files. Even though this is not
;;; declared as a constant (because ANSI Common Lisp has no facility
;;; for declaring values which are constant under EQUAL but not EQL),
;;; obviously you shouldn't mess with it lightly. If you do set a new
;;; value for some reason, keep these things in mind:
;;; * To avoid confusion with the similar but incompatible CMU CL
;;;   fasl file format, the value should not be "FASL FILE", which
;;;   is what CMU CL used for the same purpose.
;;; * Since its presence at the head of a file is used by LOAD to
;;;   decide whether a file is to be fasloaded or just loaded
;;;   ordinarily (as source), the value should be something which
;;;   can't legally appear at the head of a Lisp source file.
;;; * The value should not contain any line-terminating characters,
;;;   because they're hard to express portably and because the LOAD
;;;   code might reasonably use READ-LINE to get the value to compare
;;;   against.

;;; 60: (2005-10-24) Bumped for 0.9.6
;;; 61: (2005-11-06) Improved source location recording added extra parameters

;;; 62: (2005-12-30) Make the count of FASL header counted strings
;;;     a 32-bit value also on 64-bit platforms.
;;; 63: (2006-01-27) Shuffle storage classes around to reduce the error
;;;     trap information size on RISCy platforms.
;;; 64: (2006-03-24) New calling convention for unknown-values on x86 and
;;;     x86-64.  Also (belatedly) PPC/gencgc, including :gencgc on FPAFF.
;;; 65: (2006-04-11) Package locking interface changed.

;;; 76: (2007-10-05) MUTEX layout changes
;;; 77: (2007-11-08) Essentially obsolete fasl-file-version, fasls are now
;;;     considered compatible only when the version numbers of the compiling
;;;     SBCL instance is exactly the same as the one of the loading instance.
;;;     Further fasl-file-version bumps should only be done for real changes
