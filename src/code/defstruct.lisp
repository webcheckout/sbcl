;;; This monster has exactly one inline use in the final image,
;;; and we can drop the definition.
;;;
;;; The DELAYP argument deserves some explanation - Because :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL effects
;;; of non-toplevel DEFSTRUCT forms don't happen, the compiler is unable to produce
;;; good accessor code. By delaying compilation until the DEFSTRUCT happens, whenever
;;; or if ever that may be, we can produce better code. DELAY, if true, says to defer
;;; compilation, ignoring the original lexical environment. This approach produces a
;;; nicer expansion in general, versus macroexpanding to yet another macro whose sole
;;; purpose is to sense that earlier compile-time effects have happened.
;;;
;;; Some caveats: (1) a non-toplevel defstruct compiled after already seeing
;;; the same, due to repeated compilation of a file perhaps, will use the known
;;; definition, since technically structures must not be incompatibly redefined.
;;; (2) delayed DEFUNS don't get the right TLF index in their debug info.
;;; We could expand into the internal expansion of DEFUN with an extra argument
;;; for the source location, which would get whatever "here" is instead of random.
;;; In other words: `(progn (sb-impl::%defun struct-slot (...) ... ,(source-location))
;;; and then use that to stuff in the correct info at delayed-compile time.
;;;
;;; Note also that sb-fasteval has some hairy logic to JIT-compile slot accessors.
;;; It might be a lot nicer to pull out that junk, and have this expander know that
;;; it is producing code for fasteval, and explicitly compile much the same way
;;; that delayed accessor compilation happens. Here's a REPL session:
;;; * (defstruct foo val) => FOO
;;; * #'foo-val => #<INTERPRETED-FUNCTION FOO-VAL>
;;; * (defun foovalx (afoo) (* (foo-val afoo) 2)) => FOOVALX
;;; * (foovalx (make-foo :val 9)) => 18
;;; * #'foo-val => #<FUNCTION FOO-VAL>

;;;; instances with ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;;
;;;; The CMU CL support for structures with ALTERNATE-METACLASS was a
;;;; fairly general extension embedded in the main DEFSTRUCT code, and
;;;; the result was an fairly impressive mess as ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;; extension mixed with ANSI CL generality (e.g. :TYPE and :INCLUDE)
;;;; and CMU CL implementation hairiness (esp. raw slots). This SBCL
;;;; version is much less ambitious, noticing that ALTERNATE-METACLASS
;;;; is only used to implement CONDITION, STANDARD-INSTANCE, and
;;;; GENERIC-FUNCTION, and defining a simple specialized
;;;; separate-from-DEFSTRUCT macro to provide only enough
;;;; functionality to support those.
;;;;
;;;; KLUDGE: The defining macro here is so specialized that it's ugly
;;;; in its own way. It also violates once-and-only-once by knowing
;;;; much about structures and layouts that is already known by the
;;;; main DEFSTRUCT macro. Hopefully it will go away presently
;;;; (perhaps when CL:CLASS and SB-PCL:CLASS meet) as per FIXME below.
;;;; -- WHN 2001-10-28
;;;;
;;;; FIXME: There seems to be no good reason to shoehorn CONDITION,
;;;; STANDARD-INSTANCE, and GENERIC-FUNCTION into mutated structures
;;;; instead of just implementing them as primitive objects. (This
;;;; reduced-functionality macro seems pretty close to the
;;;; functionality of !DEFINE-PRIMITIVE-OBJECT..)

;;; The complete list of alternate-metaclass DEFSTRUCTs:
;;;   CONDITION SB-KERNEL:INTERPRETED-FUNCTION
