;;; Two versions of a special-form processor for NAME are defined:
;;; an immediate-mode processor which performs recursive-descent EVAL,
;;; and a deferred-mode processor which digests the form to produce
;;; a callable object that when called evaluates the form.
;;; KLUDGE: Any code preceding :IMMEDIATE or :DEFERRED is common to both,
;;; and stuffed in front of the mode-specific handler.
;;; Processors may be specified for ordinary macros; this permits
;;; treating things like AND/OR/COND as specials forms.
;;;
;;; If :IMMEDIATE code is unspecified, immediate mode generates a deferred
;;; handler, then call that. If specified as :NONE, the form is not treated
;;; as a special form in immediate mode - it must be a macro.
