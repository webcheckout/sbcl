 * GC_NONE -> GC_FLIGHT: unmap_gc_page(), arming the GSP trap.
 *
 * GC_FLIGHT: GC triggered normally, waiting for post-allocation
 * safepoint trap.
 *
 * GC_FLIGHT -> GC_MESSAGE: gc_notify_early(), arming the per-thread
 * CSP traps.
 *
 * GC_MESSAGE: Waiting for lisp threads to stop (WITHOUT-GCING threads
 * will resume at GC_INVOKED).
 *
 * GC_MESSAGE -> GC_INVOKED: map_gc_page(), disarming the GSP trap.
 *
 * GC_INVOKED: Waiting for WITHOUT-GCING threads to leave
 * WITHOUT-GCING.
 *
 * GC_INVOKED -> GC_QUIET: nothing changes.
 *
 * GC_QUIET: GCing threads race to stop the world (and melt with you).
 *
 * GC_QUIET -> GC_SETTLED: unmap_gc_page(), gc_notify_final(), arming
 * GSP and CSP traps again.
 *
 * GC_SETTLED: Waiting for remaining lisp threads to stop.
 *
 * GC_SETTLED -> GC_COLLECT: map_gc_page(), disarming the GSP trap.
 *
 * GC_COLLECT: World is stopped, save for one thread in SUB-GC / FLET
 * PERFORM-GC, running the garbage collector.
 *
 * GC_COLLECT -> GC_NONE: gc_none(), clearing CSP traps and possibly
 * GC_PENDING.
 *
 * GC_NONE: Free running code.
 *
 * Note that the system may not actually stop in every state for a GC.
 * For example, a system with only one thread directly invoking
 * SB-EXT:GC will advance quickly from GC_NONE to GC_COLLECT, simply
 * because no other threads exist to prevent it.  That same scenario
 * with a thread inside WITHOUT-GCING sitting in alien code at the
 * time will move to GC_INVOKED and then wait for the WITHOUT-GCING
 * thread to finish up, then proceed to GC_COLLECT. */
