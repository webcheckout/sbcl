#ifndef LISP_FEATURE_SB_THREAD
// Access to this variable from Lisp is more confusing than it should be for the 64-bit
// machines, because they have to use a half-sized store, which if nothing else forces
// the programmer to have to remember that fact. More critically, some of the uses try
// to "cheat" a write of 1 by storing from any known nonzero register into this variable
// under the assumption that any nonzero value is as good as a 1.  That's fine if the low
// half of the source register is in fact nonzero. But what if the register holds
// #x8ff00000000 ? Then the clever trick doesn't work. This is not merely a theoretical
// problem - it happened on x86-64 where thread->pa was set to true by storing the
// frame pointer ($RBP), but someone optimized the store to a 32-bit store (from $EBP)
// when the frame pointer could have held a value exactly as illustrated above.
// Ironically the CPU can do an immediate-to-mememory move, making that perhaps the most
// egregious example of premature optimization that I had ever witnessed.
// (That bug was fixed immediately upon discovery)
// Perhaps this should be turned into a 'uword_t'?
