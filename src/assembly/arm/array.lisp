  ;; Why :LINK NIL?
  ;; Either LR or PC need to always point into the code object.
  ;; Since this is a static assembly routine, PC is already not pointing there.
  ;; But it's called using blx, so LR is still good.
  ;; Normally PSEUDO-ATOMIC calls do_pending_interrupt using BLX too,
  ;; which will make LR point here, now GC can collect the parent function away.
  ;; But the call to do_pending_interrupt is at the end, and there's
  ;; nothing more needed to be done by the routine, so
  ;; do_pending_interrupt can return to the parent function directly.
  ;; This still uses the normal :return-style, BX LR, since the call
  ;; to do_pending_interrupt interrupt is conditional.
