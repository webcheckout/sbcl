;;; SBCL has no proper byte compiler (having ditched the rather
;;; ambitious and slightly flaky byte compiler inherited from CMU CL)
;;; but its FOPs are a sort of byte code which is expressive enough
;;; that we can compile some simple toplevel forms directly to them,
;;; including very common operations like the forms that DEFVARs and
;;; DECLAIMs macroexpand into.
;;;
;;; FIXME: The expexnasion problem.
;;; FOPCOMPILE and FOPCOMPILABLE-P cause multiple expansion of macros,
;;; which may be problematic with side-effecting macros. When
;;; FOPCOMPILABLE-P succeeds, FOPCOMPILE is called, resulting in
;;; double macroexpansion. When FOPCOMPILABLE-P fails,
;;; IR1-CONVERT-FUNCTOID expands already expanded macros for a second
;;; time.
;;; And an edge case, when the top-level call has a complier-macro
;;; which returns &whole it gets expanded three times, two times by
;;; FOPCOMPILABLE-P and FOPCOMPILE, and one time by
;;; PROCESS-TOPLEVEL-FORM, because unlike other macros, the expanded
;;; form is still a macro-form. That's what the EXPAND optional
;;; parameter solves, PROCESS-TOPLEVEL-FORM passes NIL, expanding
;;; compiler macros at most once.
;;; The instances of double expansion still remain, e.g. (fun (macro)),
;;; since PROCESS-TOPLEVEL-FORM only expands the macros at the first
;;; position.
