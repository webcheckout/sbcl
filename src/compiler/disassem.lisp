  "DEFINE-INSTRUCTION-FORMAT (Name Length {Format-Key Value}*) Arg-Def*
  Define an instruction format NAME for the disassembler's use. LENGTH is
  the length of the format in bits.
  Possible FORMAT-KEYs:

  :INCLUDE other-format-name
      Inherit all arguments and properties of the given format. Any
      arguments defined in the current format definition will either modify
      the copy of an existing argument (keeping in the same order with
      respect to when prefilters are called), if it has the same name as
      one, or be added to the end.
  :DEFAULT-PRINTER printer-list
      Use the given PRINTER-LIST as a format to print any instructions of
      this format when they don't specify something else.

  Each ARG-DEF defines one argument in the format, and is of the form
    (Arg-Name {Arg-Key Value}*)

  Possible ARG-KEYs (the values are evaluated unless otherwise specified):

  :FIELDS byte-spec-list
      The argument takes values from these fields in the instruction. If
      the list is of length one, then the corresponding value is supplied by
      itself; otherwise it is a list of the values. The list may be NIL.
  :FIELD byte-spec
      The same as :FIELDS (list byte-spec).

  :VALUE value
      If the argument only has one field, this is the value it should have,
      otherwise it's a list of the values of the individual fields. This can
      be overridden in an instruction-definition or a format definition
      including this one by specifying another, or NIL to indicate that it's
      variable.

  :SIGN-EXTEND boolean
      If non-NIL, the raw value of this argument is sign-extended,
      immediately after being extracted from the instruction (before any
      prefilters are run, for instance). If the argument has multiple
      fields, they are all sign-extended.

  :TYPE arg-type-name
      Inherit any properties of the given argument type.

  :PREFILTER function
      A function which is called (along with all other prefilters, in the
      order that their arguments appear in the instruction-format) before
      any printing is done, to filter the raw value. Any uses of READ-SUFFIX
      must be done inside a prefilter.

  :PRINTER function-string-or-vector
      A function, string, or vector which is used to print this argument.

  :USE-LABEL
      If non-NIL, the value of this argument is used as an address, and if
      that address occurs inside the disassembled code, it is replaced by a
      label. If this is a function, it is called to filter the value."

;;;     format) before any printing is done, to filter the raw value.
;;;     Any uses of READ-SUFFIX must be done inside a prefilter.
;;;
;;; :PRINTER function-string-or-vector
;;;     A function, string, or vector which is used to print an argument of
;;;     this type.

;;; :USE-LABEL
;;;     If non-NIL, the value of an argument of this type is used as
;;;     an address, and if that address occurs inside the disassembled
;;;     code, it is replaced by a label. If this is a function, it is
;;;     called to filter the value.
