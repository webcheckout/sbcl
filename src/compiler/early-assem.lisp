;;; FIXME: It might make sense to use SB-VM:BYTE-FOO values here
;;; instead of the various ASSEMBLY-UNIT-FOO things, and then define a
;;; BYTE type. One problem: BYTE is exported from the CL package, so
;;; ANSI says that we're not supposed to be attaching any new meanings
;;; to it. Perhaps rename SB-VM:BYTE-FOO to SB-VM:VMBYTE-FOO or
;;; SB-VM:VM-BYTE-FOO, and then define the SB-VM:VMBYTE or
;;; SB-VM:VM-BYTE types?
;;;
;;; If this was done, some of this file could go away, and the rest
;;; could probably be merged back into assem.lisp. (This file was
;;; created simply in order to move the ASSEMBLY-UNIT-related
;;; definitions before compiler/generic/core.lisp in the build
;;; sequence.)
