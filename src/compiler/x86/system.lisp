;;;; Miscellany

;;; the RDTSC instruction (present on Pentium processors and
;;; successors) allows you to access the time-stamp counter, a 64-bit
;;; model-specific register that counts executed cycles. The
;;; instruction returns the low cycle count in EAX and high cycle
;;; count in EDX.
;;;
;;; In order to obtain more significant results on out-of-order
;;; processors (such as the Pentium II and later), we issue a
;;; serializing CPUID instruction before reading the cycle counter.
;;; This instruction is used for its side effect of emptying the
;;; processor pipeline, to ensure that the RDTSC instruction is
;;; executed once all pending instructions have been completed.
;;; CPUID writes to EBX and ECX in addition to EAX and EDX, so
;;; they need to be added as temporaries.
;;;
;;; Note that cache effects mean that the cycle count can vary for
;;; different executions of the same code (it counts cycles, not
;;; retired instructions). Furthermore, the results are per-processor
;;; and not per-process, so are unreliable on multiprocessor machines
;;; where processes can migrate between processors.
;;;
;;; This method of obtaining a cycle count has the advantage of being
;;; very fast (around 20 cycles), and of not requiring a system call.
;;; However, you need to know your processor's clock speed to translate
;;; this into real execution time.
;;;
;;; FIXME: This about the WITH-CYCLE-COUNTER interface a bit, and then
;;; perhaps export it from SB-SYS.
