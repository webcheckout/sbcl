;;; ### Note: we simultaneously use ``word'' to mean a 32 bit quantity

;;; insists on calling 16 bit things words and 32 bit things
;;; double-words (or dwords). Therefore, in the instruction definition
;;; and register specs, we use the Intel convention. But whenever we
;;; are talking about stuff the rest of the lisp system might be
;;; interested in, we use ``word'' to mean the size of a descriptor
;;; object, which is 32 bits.

;;;; description of the target address space

;;; where to put the different spaces
;;;
;;; Note: Mostly these values are black magic, inherited from CMU CL
;;; without any documentation. However, there were a few explanatory
;;; comments in the CMU CL sources:
;;;   * On Linux,
;;;     ** The space 0x08000000-0x10000000 is "C program and memory allocation".
;;;     ** The space 0x40000000-0x48000000 is reserved for shared libs.
;;;     ** The space >0xE0000000 is "C stack - Alien stack".
;;;   * On FreeBSD,
;;;     ** The space 0x0E000000-0x10000000 is "Foreign segment".
;;;     ** The space 0x20000000-0x30000000 is reserved for shared libs.
;;; And there have been some changes since the fork from CMU CL:
;;;   * The OpenBSD port is new since the fork. We started with
;;;     the FreeBSD address map, which actually worked until the
;;;     Alpha port patches, for reasons which in retrospect are rather
;;;     mysterious. After the Alpha port patches were added, the
;;;     OpenBSD port suffered memory corruption problems. While
;;;     debugging those, it was discovered that src/runtime/trymap
;;;     failed for the control stack region #x40000000-#x47fff000.
;;;     After the control stack was moved upward out of this region
;;;     (stealing some bytes from dynamic space) the problems went
;;;     away.
;;;   * The FreeBSD STATIC-SPACE-START value was bumped up from
;;;     #x28000000 to #x30000000 when FreeBSD ld.so dynamic linking
;;;     support was added for FreeBSD ca. 20000910. This was to keep from
;;;     stomping on an address range that the dynamic libraries want to
;;;     use. (They want to use this address range even if we try to
;;;     reserve it with a call to validate() as the first operation in
;;;     main().)
;;;   * For NetBSD 2.0, the following ranges are used by normal
;;;     executables and mmap:
;;;     ** Executables are (by default) loaded at 0x08048000.
;;;     ** The break for the sbcl runtime seems to end around 0x08400000
;;;     We set read only space around 0x20000000, static
;;;     space around 0x30000000, all ending below 0x37fff000
;;;     ** ld.so and other mmap'ed stuff like shared libs start around
;;;        0x48000000
;;;     We set dynamic space between 0x60000000 and 0x98000000
;;;     ** Bottom of the stack is typically not below 0xb0000000
;;;     FYI, this can be looked at with the "pmap" program, and if you
;;;     set the top-down mmap allocation option in the kernel (not yet
;;;     the default), all bets are totally off!
;;;   * For FreeBSD, the requirement of user and kernel space are
;;;     getting larger, and users tend to extend them.
;;;     If MAXDSIZ is extended from 512MB to 1GB, we can't use up to
;;;     around 0x50000000.
;;;     And if KVA_PAGES is extended from 1GB to 1.5GB, we can't use
;;;     down to around 0xA0000000.
;;;     So we use 0x58000000--0x98000000 for dynamic space.
;;;   * For OpenBSD, the following ranges are used:
;;;     ** Non-PIE executables' text segments start at #x1c000000 and
;;;        data segments 512MB higher at #x3c000000.
;;;     ** Shared library text segments are randomly located between
;;;        #x00002000 and #x10002000, with each data segment located
;;;        512MB higher.
;;;     ** OpenBSD 6.3 and earlier place random malloc/mmap
;;;        allocations in the range starting 1GB after the end of the
;;;        data segment and extending for 256MB.
;;;     ** After OpenBSD 6.3, this range starts 128MB after the end of
;;;        the data segment and extends for 1GB.

;;; table: "In CMUCL: 0xB0000000->0xB1000000"
