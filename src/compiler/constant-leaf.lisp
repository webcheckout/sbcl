;;; This file was split out from 'node' because it contains a reference to
;;; an IR2 structure and has no explicit references from IR1 structures
;;; (in terms of the :TYPE option to defstruct slots).
;;; The other IR1 types involved in dependency cycles are always going
;;; to cause a problem unless the compiler is enhanced to deal with cycles.

;;; The CONSTANT structure is used to represent known constant values.
;;; Since the same constant leaf may be shared between named and anonymous
;;; constants, %SOURCE-NAME is never used.
