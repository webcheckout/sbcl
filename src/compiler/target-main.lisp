;;;; CL:COMPILE

;;; Handle the following:
;;;  - CL:COMPILE when the argument is not already a compiled function.
;;;  - %SIMPLE-EVAL in "pretend we don't have an interpreter" mode
;;;    a/k/a "compile all the things"
;;;  - SB-INTERPRETER::EVAL-IN-ENVIRONMENT when it can't just do that.

;;; If ERORRP is true signals an error immediately -- otherwise returns
;;; a function that will signal the error.

;; times as there are calls to the function - not very defensible
;; as a design choice, but just an accident of the particular implementation.
