;;;; This file is for testing bivalent stream functionality, using
;;;; test machinery which might have side effects (e.g.  executing
;;;; DEFUN, writing files).  Note that the tests here might reach into
;;;; unexported functionality, and should not be used as a guide for
;;;; users.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test
;;;; files (like this one) were written from scratch after the fork
;;;; from CMU CL.

;;;; This software is in the public domain and is provided with
