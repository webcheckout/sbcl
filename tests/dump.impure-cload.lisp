;; can only mean that you write values into slots of the reconstructed
;; object that were bound in the compile-time object.
;;
;; However "Uninitialized slots in object are not initialized" has two
;; opposing meanings depending on whether the verb is "are" which
;; expresses state versus "are [not] initialized" which expresses inaction.
;; For a similar grammatical construction, DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION

;; In that sentence "is [not] called" means that "calling" does NOT happen.
;; Analogously, "is [not] initialized" would imply that initializing
;; does NOT happen; it does NOT imply that "uninitializing" DOES happen.
;;
;; It seems though, that "are [not] initialized" actually means
;; SHALL be made to become uninitialized. This is based on the Notes
;; below the main description referencing SLOT-MAKUNBOUND.
;; (Though muddied by use of weasel-words "could" and "might")
;;
;; Ultimately the two end states (doing something / not doing something)
;; agree when the slot is local to the object, and no behavior is imparted
;; by ALLOCATE-INSTANCE to cause slots to be other than unbound.
